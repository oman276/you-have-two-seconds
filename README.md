A game created by me for the United Game Jam (June 28, 2020)

~~~~

This game was created over a period of 48 hours (June 26 - June 28, 2020) for the United Game Jam. I used C# and Unity.

I've experimented with coding and making games before, but this is the first full, presentable, completed project I've made with Unity and C#. I had taken 
programming classes and a few practice online courses, but this was the first time I had to properly design code without a guide, along with debugging, 
creating art, etc. The theme was "two", so I decided to make a game of bite-sized platforming challenges you must complete in two seconds. 

Despite my preparation, there were many things I had to learn on the fly. Making player movement feel satisfying on the keyboard was a challenge, one that 
took me a while to fully understand. Another thing that I struggled with was figuring out how to share data between different scripts and different scenes. 
Eventually, I figured it out, using GameObjects modifited to not delete when the game loads a new scene. 

There were 288 total submissions to the jam. My game ranked in the top 40% Overall, and in the top 33% for design. All art, sound, and code were made by me.
